# Flexbox Grid Assignment

In this assignment you're going to build a grid using SCSS and flexbox.

The width of each column is 100% divided by the number of columns within the
flex container (.row). Adding another will divide the row once again.

In the layout.scss file, you're going to write Sass to create this grid.
Remember, you SCSS is just a subset of CSS. You can write valid CSS in SCSS.

Don't worry about compiling your SCSS into CSS for now. In the next lecture, we
will cover the build tool to bring your grid to life.
